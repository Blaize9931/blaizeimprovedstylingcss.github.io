        <br>Types: Tags can be paired, or self-closing.</br>
        <br>Attributes: Tags often have attributes that provide additional information about an element, such as class, id, style, etc.</br>
        <br>Purpose: They help structure the content on a webpage by defining headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other elements.</br>

      <td class="intro">I have learnt about using font-face, and linking fonts.</td>    
     
      <td class="information" id="fonts" >

        
        The CSS @font-face rule allows external fonts or font files to be imported directly into stylesheets.The location of the font file must be specified in the CSS rule so that the files can be loaded from that location. This rule also allows locally hosted fonts to be added using a relative file path instead of a web URL.
        
        <br>
        Linking fonts allow user to use web fonts in the document. They can be imported in an HTML document by using the link tag. Once the web font URL is placed within the href attribute, the imported font can then be used in CSS declaration.
